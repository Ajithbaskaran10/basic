    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-cleansing-introduction/" target="_blank" title="Data Cleaning Process"><h2 class="data-cleaning">1 . Data Cleaning :</h2></a>
    <p class="cleaning">Data cleaning is the process of preparing data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted. This data is usually not necessary or helpful when it comes to analyzing data because it may hinder the process or provide inaccurate results</p>

    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-matlab/" target="_blank" title="Matlab Simple Example"><h2 class="matlab">2 . MatLab</h2></a>
    <p class="matlab1">MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages</p>

    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language-tutorial/" target="_blank" title="Python learn"><h2 class="python">4 . Python</h2></a>
    <p class="pythonpro">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.</p>

    <p class="nosql">SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language). NoSQL databases use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML, YAML, or binary schema, facilitating unstructured data. SQL has a fixed-defined schema, while NoSQL databases are more flexible</p>

    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/" target="_blank" title="Machine Learning"><h2 class="machine">6 . Machine Learning</h2></a>
    <p class="learning">Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing systems that learn—or improve performance—based on the data they ingest. Artificial intelligence is a broad word that refers to systems or machines that resemble human intelligence. Machine learning and AI are frequently discussed together, and the terms are occasionally used interchangeably, although they do not signify the same thing. A crucial distinction is that, while all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.</p>

    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-algebra/" target="_blank" title="Linear Algebra and calculas"><h2 class="linear">7 . Linear Algebra And Calculas</h2></a>
    <p class="algebra">Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations. It deals with linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and determinants. It has a wide range of application in Physics and Mathematics. It is the basic concept for machine learning and data science. We have explained the Linear Algebra, types of Linear Algebra.</p>

    <p class="lazation">Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format (Visualization of Data could be: charts, graphs, and maps). Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. Data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyzing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions. The concept of using pictures is to understand data that has been used for centuries. General types of data visualization are Charts, Tables, Graphs, Maps, and Dashboards.</p>
